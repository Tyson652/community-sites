We're bringing together everyone who is as excited about the potential of GraphQL as we are.

We've got an inspiring lineup of speakers to help introduce you to GraphQL and show you how it can help you build better APIs faster than ever.

We'll be trialling an incredible new venue too, thanks to Domain.

Some light food and drinks will be available thanks to Alembic.

Follow us on Twitter for updates.

Can't wait to see you there!

Josh, James and Suzie
