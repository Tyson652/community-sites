It’s been a while but we’re back and ready to kick off a year filled with as much GraphQL as you can handle. We've got a new CBD venue thanks to Atlassian, and a great lineup of talks!
Andi Marek will be talking about how they use GraphQL at Atlassian.

Rich Buggy will give us a tour of using AWS AppSync to build your GraphQL servers.
We'll also be running much more regularly, so look out for future dates.      
Brought to you with ❤️ by Alembic and Atlassian!

Josh and James and Suz
