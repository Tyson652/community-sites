    paragraph1:
      We meet the 1st Wednesday of each month to talk about Elixir and Erlang and associated technologies.
      Most months we have talks but we sometimes host practical coding nights.
      Beginners are always welcome to join and we try to keep talks accessible to those new to the language and ecosystem.
