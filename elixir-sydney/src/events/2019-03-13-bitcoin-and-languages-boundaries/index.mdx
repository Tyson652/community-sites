First Elixir meetup for 2019!

Hope you all had a wonderful holiday and are excited about the future of our favourite programming ecosystem. Beginners are more than welcome, and this a great chance to get started and get help from more experienced Elixir developers.

Thanks to Pivotal Labs for hosting us.
