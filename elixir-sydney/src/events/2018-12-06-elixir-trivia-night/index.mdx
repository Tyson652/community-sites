In a format we've blatantly stolen borrowed from the end of year Cocoaheads trivia festival, we'll be throwing random questions at you which will stretch your noodles and maybe even teach you some interesting facts about Elixir or Erlang. Or maybe just programming in general.

Elixir and Erlang developers of all levels are welcome. Whether you are a complete beginner or just little curious about the powers of OTP and the BEAM. The Elixir Sydney Meetup is a great chance to get started and mingle with experienced Elixir developers and others just starting the journey.

See you there,

Josh, James and Andrew
