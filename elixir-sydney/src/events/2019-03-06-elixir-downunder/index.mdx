    description: In a format we've blatantly stolen borrowed from the end of year Cocoaheads trivia festival, we'll be throwing random questions at you which will stretch your noodles and maybe even teach you some interesting facts about Elixir or Erlang. Or maybe just programming in general.

Honoured to have Sophie and Alison give us a special preview of their talk for ElixirConfEU. They'll be talking about how Elixir is driving innovation in Australia.

Qing will give us a quick recap of Ecto and take us through the new features and upgrade path for Ecto 3.

Beginners are more than welcome, and this a great chance to get started and get help from more experienced Elixir developers.

Thanks to Expert360 for hosting us and providing drinks, thanks Alembic for providing the food.

See you there,

Josh and James
