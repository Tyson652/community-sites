    title: Beyond Simple Types in Elm
    description: |
      Elm gives us the ability to use types to talk about the shape of our data. It's really tempting to just use simple things like String, Number, etc, but there's a bunch of ways we can tell Elm more about what we intend, and use types as a tool instead of just a constraint.

    title: Intro to GraphQL with Elixir
    description: |
      GraphQL is a relevant up and coming API technology that offers API consumers much more flexibility than REST. It's a well-defined standard (as opposed to REST, which is convention driven) and supports streaming and subscriptions. Elixir is an ideal platform on which to build GraphQL APIs.

    title: Introduction to Elm
    description: |
      Just like Elixir challenges some of Ruby’s design decisions on the backend, Elm challenges aspects of the JavaScript language on the frontend to create a delightful developer experience. In this session, you’ll get a grand tour of the sources of developer happiness in Elm, and hopefully be convinced to give this exciting new language a closer look.
