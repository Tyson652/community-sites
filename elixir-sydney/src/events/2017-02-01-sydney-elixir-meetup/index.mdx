Nick Gunn will reveal the awesome power of Supervisors.

Robin Hilliard will show us How to release Hex packages and tell us about his first: DefUnit

We'll also discuss what has been happening in Elixir-land (like Elixir 1.4.1 and friends).

Beginners are more than welcome, and this a great chance to get started and get help from more experienced Elixir developers.
