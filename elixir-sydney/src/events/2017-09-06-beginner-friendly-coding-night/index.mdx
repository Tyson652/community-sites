It's been a while since we had a practical coding night, so bring your laptop and bring your project ideas or questions and we'll have plenty of experienced Alchemists to help you with whatever you're working on.

Beginners are more than welcome, and this a great chance to get started and get help from more experienced Elixir developers.

See you there!

Josh, Andrew and James
