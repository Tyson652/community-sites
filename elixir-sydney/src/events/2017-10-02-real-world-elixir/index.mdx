This month we've got some great talks lined up and from some new speakers too!

Dan will tell us about some of the forces influencing Expert360's decision to double down on Elixir and the "Modular Monolith".

Mark will take a look at Functional Programming with Elixir through the lens of an experience OO practitioner.

Beginners are more than welcome, and this a great chance to get started and get help from more experienced Elixir developers.

See you there!

Josh, Andrew and James
